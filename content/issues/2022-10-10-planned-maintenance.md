We are planning to put the dddice site into maintenance mode in order to release dddice v0.6.0. This is one-time planned maintenance that should take roughly an hour, however, we are planning for up to 3-hours of possible downtime as we perform a DNS switchover.

A DNS switchover theoretically can take a few hours but could take as little as 5-minutes.
